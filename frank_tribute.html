   <br><p style="font-size:2vw;">Elon Musk is the founder and CEO of SpaceX, Tesla and Neuralink.<br> Moreover, those are only small pieces of his grand-scale puzzle <br>that leads to a better future and the colonization of Mars.</p>
    <br><p style="background-color:black; color:white;">Here is a timeline of Elon Musk's life events:</p> 
    <ul style="font-size:2vw;"> 
      
     
      <li>In 1983 he created a video game and sold it for 500$</li>  
      <li>At the age of 14, Elon decided that his life mission is to save humanity</li> 
      <li>In 1989, he started college in Ontario</li> 
      <li>In 1994, he got Wharton economics and physics degrees</li>
      <li>After that he worked two intern jobs and brainstormed ideas </li>
      <li>He left Stanford PhD after 2 days</li>
      <li>In 1995, Musk starts Zip2 with his brother, coding it himself</li>
      <li>After sleeping in the office for 3 months, he raised his first investment money (3M), and later sold his share for $22 Million</li> 
      <li>In 1999, he starts X.com - an online bank with his own money</li> 
      <li>In 2000, he merges with his rival start-up Confinity to form PayPal</li> 
      <li>Later that same year, he got ousted from PayPal as a CEO (while on honeymoon). Regardless of that, Musk continues to invest money in it</li> 
      <li>In 2001, Elon moved to LA to be closer to the space industry and learned how to build rockets from books</li> 
      <li>In 2002, after finding out that rockets are overpriced, the ambitious entrepreneur started Space X and got 250M from sale of PayPal</li>
      <li>In 2004, he founded likeminded people and started his venture into electric cars - TESLA</li> 
      <li>In 2006, his first rocket was launched and exploded. Moreover, he won a NASA contracts to demo delivery and became the first investor of Solar City - his cousin's company</li> 
      <li>In 2007, his second rocket was launched... and exploded again</li> 
      <li>In 2008, the first TESLA customers got their Roadsters at $109,000. What is more, another failed attempt at launching a rocket brought both TESLA and Space X to the crisis of running out of money. However, his fourth launch turned successful which won him a NASA contract for 12 flights for $1,6 Billion. In december 2008, hours before going bankrupt, Elon found funding for TESLA.</li> 
      <li>In 2009, Musk unveiled the Model S car</li>

      <li>In 2015, Musk unveiled Powerwall, first customers got their Model X. However, there was also a failed launch of a rocket (after 19 successful launches) but also a successul landing of the first reusable rocket to reach orbit.</li>
